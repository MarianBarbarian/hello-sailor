	  	<P title="whatarelions">
		Lions are large felines that are traditionally depicted as the "king of the jungle." These big cats once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe. However, now they are found in only two areas of the world and are classified into two subspecies. Asiatic lions live in India's Gir Forest; African lions live in central and southern Africa. Though they look similar, these two subspecies are very different in size, habitat, diet and more.</P><br><br>

		<p title="habits">
		Lions are very social cats and live in groups called prides. Asiatic and African lion prides are very different, though.African lion prides consist of up to three males, around a dozen females, and their young, according to National Geographic. There are prides that have as many as 40 members, though. Asian lions divide themselves into two prides. The females have a pride and the males have a pride. They only come together during mating season.
		With both types of lion prides, the females stay put. All of the females in a pride are usually related to each other because females tend to stay with the pride in which they are born. Males, on the other hand, wander off to create their own pride when they are old enough.<br><br>
